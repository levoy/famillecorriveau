	<h3><div style="text-align:justify;">

	To anyone having difficulties finding Corriveau descendants, especially in Quebec, please leave me a message by mail or e-mail. 
	I am sure that we can unravel your puzzle together.
	<br><br>

	I think I can be of some help to many people as I have already recorded more than 50,200 names related to the Corriveau family.
	<br><br>

	My research is still ongoing, especially with respect the family members who started immigrating to the States in 1840. There are now 
	many descendants of those numerous braves who decided to leave Canada for an unknown country which I assume they felt would lead to a better life.
	<br><br>

	Let's not forget all new descendants who are born to ensure the continuity of the Corriveau name.
	<br><br>

	I do not keep count on the number of names I exchange with other searchers although I have found at times that some searchers do not respond 
	when it is their turn to give out information. 
	<br><br>

	I hope that I will hear from many searchers who are willing to exchange information.
        <br><br>
