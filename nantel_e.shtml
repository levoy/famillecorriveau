	<h1><center> Jean Berlouin known as Nantel </center></h1>

	<h3><div style="text-align:justify;">

	Son of Jacques Berloin and Jeanne Charron, parish of Saint-Leger of the city of Saint-Maxient, arch-bishop of Pointiers in Poitou, Jean Berlouin 
	married Marguerite Forget, Sunday, November 7th, 1694 before Notary Fleuricourt. Marguerite Forget was the daughter of Nicolas Forget and Madeleine Martin, 
	widow of Jean Mouloin. She was baptised Thursday April 8, 1666, in Montreal. They had five children.
	<br><br>

	After his wife passed away in July 1704, he signed a marriage contract with Marguerite Delpeche before Notary Senet, Sunday, September 13, 1705 and 
	married her Monday, September 14, 1705, at Saint Francois de l'ile Jesus. She was born Monday January 17, 1678 in Repentigny, QC to the late Bernard Delpêche 
	and Marguerite Jourdain. They had seven children.
	<br><br>

	He established himself at Ile Jesus on a land concession of four by twenty acres which he received from the Sulpiciens on May 27, 1698. His wife had been 
	married to Jean Mouloin, who on September 12, 1693, with Nicolas Forget, had rented out land belonging to Pierre Perrotin in Lachesnaye. Ignace Nafrechoux, 
	attorney for Pierre Perrotin, gave them a rent receipt for 116 pounds and 5 sols on March 16, 1701. This debt was reimbursed with 15 minots of wheat.
	<br><br>

	His wife passed away July 26, 1701 while giving birth to a child who did not survive.
	<br><br>

	On January 14, 1705, a property inventory was done by a Notary by the name of Senet. The division of the property took place on January 27, 1705. There were 
	seven heirs from both marriages, namely Jean Mouloin to Marguerite Forget and Jean Nantel to Marguerite Forget. The land to share was as follows: the land 
	situated in Laschenaye measuring six by twenty acres, which land had belonged to Mouloin on which Jean Nantel was living at the time and another land measuring 
	four by twenty acres at Ile Jesus. The two lands were divided into three lots and were drawn in order to simplify matters: one lot for the heirs of the first 
	marriage, another lot for the heirs of the second marriage and one for himself. He was left with his land at Ile Jesus.
	<br><br>

	His new wife had inherited a fifth of 90 acres of land with a small island in Repentigny. With her consent, he sold it to Jean-Baptiste Thouin on November 5, 1706, 
	for a sum of 155 pounds, the later gave him a mare worth 80 pounds as partial payment. He gave the buyer a final release on June 7, 1710 while he was at Hotel Dieu 
	hospital in Montreal.
	<br><br>

	He had incurred a debt of 118 pounds, 2 sols and 7 deniers toward Pierre Perthuis which was recorded by a notary named Adhemar, November 12, 1706. He obtains a 
	release on January 14, 1709 after having paid off all his debts. He had been living in Pointe-aux-Trembles since February 14, 1708 having leased land for a five year 
	term from an innkeeper by the name of Joseph Martel. The lease ends on a misunderstanding between them. All property he owns on the farm is seized including grain, 
	following a request from the landlord to the provotship in Montreal, February 26, 1714. This goes to arbitration and there is an understanding following judgment of the 
	arbitrators Nicolas Desroches and Toussaint Beaudry. He died on November 4, 1740 at Ile Jesus and was buried the day after. His widow wed Joseph Labelle, November 24, 1743. 
	<br><br>

	<h2> Your ancestor was a militia captain. </h2>

	The Canadian militia institution goes back to Frontenac who was a governor. At the beginning there was only one captain for many groups as the many groups were 
	scattered along the coast. A missionnary went from post to post as the posts had not yet been made into parishes. The captain was named then "Coast Captail". Later on, 
	each group became a parish as it became larger and each parish had its own captain called the militia captain.
	<br><br>

	It was the duty of the militia captain to communicate orders received from the governor to the people of his parish. He also acted as a bailiff. From time to time he 
	had to do military exercise which was limited to target shooting. 
	<br>
	Militia officers, all of them a land owner, never received any pay for their work. They were recognised as carrying the orders of the government and this honour was their 
	salary. The militia from coast to coast was used as a means of communication in times of peace or war. Nowadays, we have the internet. 
	<br><br>

	The militia or coast captain had his own seat at church till Confederation.  After England took the country over, the military authorities gave the militia captains many 
	duties, namely court judge. They were well thought of and remained active in various duties in the justice field.
	<br>
	Militia captains did not let English officers impress them; they knew they counted on them and they were entitled to respect from the public. As military men, they 
	understood war in this country better than officers from Europe.
