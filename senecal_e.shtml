	<h1><center> Senecal in America </center></h1>

	<h3><div style="text-align:justify;">

	I have tried to collect all Senecals living in America, mainly in Quebec, where it is easier to find how they related to their ancestors. Although it is not always 
	obvious as there are many Senecals who have immigrated South and it is sometimes impossible to find their origins in order to link them to one of the ancestors. 
	The same situation applies to those who have moved to Ontario and Western Canada. Please do not confuse the name Senecal with Senechal as some have done in the past. 
	The Senechal lineage originated in Quebec with the arrival of Jacques Senechal, son of Pierre Senechal and Marguerite Briand, who wed Marie-Josephe Pelletier on March 1st, 1745 
	at Saint-Roch-des-Aulnais.
	<br><br>

	This couple had twelve children who contributed to the descendants of this lineage in the Quebec region. Of course, nowadays, we find Senechal who were originally 
	Senecal and vice versa. 
	<br><br>

	Three Senecal arrived from France. Let's talk about Louise Senecal first: she arrived in 1667 with a group called "Filles du Roi". She was born on February 15, 1637 
	to Pierre Senecal and Françoise Campion, at Saint-Eloi de Rouen, Normandie. She brought a dowry evaluated at 200 pounds. She married Pierre Guilbault, son of 
	François Guilbault and Marie Pignon, October 6, 1667, at Saint-Barhelemy de la Rochelle. They had four children. 
	<br><br>

	Then came Adrien Senécal around 1669. His lineage is unknown to me. Assumed to be born in 1619, he married Guillemette Rolleville at Benouville, arch-diocese of Rouen, 
	Normandie. They had two children. Both children immigrated to New France with their father after their mother passed away. Then, around 1669, Adrien married 
	Jeanne Lecomte of unknown lineage. Their four children formed the most important Senecal lineage of descendants: they are recorded in the book I have written, 
	as shown in the first part of this book. 
	<br><br>

	And lastly, came Jean Senecal, born September 20, 1646 at Saint-Martin de Paluel, near Dieppe, Normandie. I assume he is related to Adrien as they are both from the 
	same region in France. Son of Martin Senecal and Jeanne Lappert, he married Catherine Desenne, daughter of Pierre Desenne and Marguerite Leger, parish of 
	Notre-Dame du Chemin, city of Orleans, October 25, 1672, in Montreal. They had seven children. I have not found many descendants from this ancestor which leads me to 
	believe that they did not have many children. However, he had business acumen as you can see at the beginning of the second part of this book. There are 3,325 
	Senecal descendants distributed among 765 families over 13 generations.
