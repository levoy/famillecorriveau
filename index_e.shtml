	<h3><div style="text-align:justify;">
        The objective of this page is to acquaint yourself with the Corriveau family and its many designations throughout America:
        <ul>
                <li type="disc"> Carriveau
                <li type="disc"> Carvo
                <li type="disc"> Curvo
                <li type="disc"> Corrivaux
                <li type="disc"> Corrivaud
                <li type="disc"> Corrivault
                <li type="disc"> Courivaud
        </ul>

	The objective is also to reunite in one book all descendants of Etienne and Catherine Bureau, our common ancestries, and to share with you all 
	information that has been gathered in the last twenty years or so. 
        <br><br>

	Many stories have been written on the Corriveau family, escecially about Marie Joseph who has not had a very good reputation in the XVIII century. 
	I do not aim to judge nor to give a personal opinion; I only want to say that the Corriveau family is like any other family with good and bad elements. 
	Historians are there to write stories, I am a genealogist.
        <br><br>

	I have been publishing books on the Corriveau family for many years. My last book contains exactly the names of 10,417 descendants of Etienne Corriveau 
	with our ancestry's name, all names classified by generations and families as well as an alphabetical index. There are a few exceptions to this rule. 
	The first exception is if some descendants have married a Corriveau descendant. The second exception is one direct cousin: my father had only one sister, 
	so this cousin's family name is Charron.  The third exception is the two children of my only sister who bear their father's name, namely Gauthier. This book 
	is not about the Corriveau's history. However, it contains many notes on some of its members who have been famous one way or the other. The book starts 
	with four pages summarizing its contents, its aim, my ancestry as well as the search method because it has been printed Register style. This method consists 
	in numerizing people: as an example, the father is #1, each child who has descendants has its own number as well as his children. A number is never used twice. 
        <br><br>

	You will not find the Corriveau name in the index as there are two many descendants with the same first name. It would be too fastidious to search for the 
	Joseph you are looking for amongst the 132 Joseph Corriveau. To reduce the space used, the search is done using either the names of the spouses or the name 
	of the mother of the person you are looking for.  
        <br><br>

	The 2004 English version titled "The Corriveau of America" is still available.
