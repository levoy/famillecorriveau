	<br><br>
	The book on the descendants of Senecals of America was published at the beginning of December 2008. <br>
	Three Senecals came from France to populate New France. First, Louise arrives from Rouen, Normandie, she belongs to the Guilbault descendants of America. 
	Then comes Adrien in 1669, he is from Bénouville, near Rouen, Normandie. Lastly, Jean arrives from Saint-Martin de Paluel, not far from Dieppe, Normandie, approximately in 1670.
	I assume the three are related as they all came from the same region in France.
