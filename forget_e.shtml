	<h1><center> Forget known as Latour </center></h1>

	<h3><div style="text-align:justify;">

	Where does this name come from? Good question. I aim to give you the results of my research.
	<br><br>

	Firstly, I found that the direct ancestor of the Forget known as Latour is Pierre Latour. He wed Etiennette Banliac December 1, 1705 at Ile du Pas. 
	She was just 17 years old, he was 34. The name "known as Laforge" comes from the word "forgeron" in the French language, "forgeron" meaning blacksmith, 
	as this was his profession.
	<br><br>

	Etiennette is the daughter of Francois Banliac known as Lamontagne and Marie Angelique Pelletier who were married in 1680 at Louiseville, Quebec. This city was 
	then known as: "La seigneurie de la Rivière du Loup". Francois arrived in Canada in 1665 with the company of Sieur La Fouille, at the Carignan-Saliere regiment. 
	After leaving the regiment he became a clog maker. He was originally from the Angouleme Region, in France. 
	<br><br>

	Where does the name Pierre Latour come from? I am unable to relate him to our ancestor with any certainty as I have not found anything indicating where he came from. 
	The 1681 census shows a 15 year old apprentice by the name of Pierre Latour, working for a Quebec note-worthy man. 
	<br><br>

	The couple, Pierre Latour and Etiennette Banliac have left many descendents: six daughters and five sons, all children having contributed to the extension of the name 
	except two. 
	<br><br>

	Although they have all been baptised under the name Latour known as Laforge, many descendants nowadays are called Forget, the Latour having been removed.  
	I have found a few named Laforge which is as legal a name as Forget. Others have kept the name of Latour. 
	<br><br>
 

	Where does this name come from?  Good question... I will tell you about the fruits of my research.
	<br><br>

	First of all I will tell you that going back to our ancestor Forget dit Latour we find that his name was Pierre Latour and that he married Etienne Blanliac, December 1, 1705 
	at Ile du Pas. She was just 17 whereas is age was double of hers and he was a blacksmith, in French "forgeron", hence he was named "Laforge".
	<br><br>

	Etienne is Francois Banliac's daughter, named Lamontagne and Marie Angelique Pelletier. They married in 1860, in Louiseville QC at a place named then "La Seigneurie du Loup". 
	Francois had arrived in the country in 1665 with Sieur La Fouille's entourage, of Carignan-Salliere's regiment. After leaving the regiment, he becomes a sabotier in 
	Seigneurie du Loup lordship. He was from Angouleme in France.
	<br><br>

	Where does our Pierre Latour come from?  I cannot say for now as I have not been able to find his origins.
